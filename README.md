Every day the webpage will show at the top right corner, the running balance of how much money you would of made had you invested $1 in brightflow September 25, 2024

 There should be some sort of yellow line on a black background with grey lines representing a cell and depicted as a graph, showing the activity of it going up and down, so that he can visually depict whether we're making money or not
On that same graph will be another line showing SPY stock line in red and how it is doing against the brightflow line so users can compare which one is doing better
There will be other lines like Vanguardâ€™s VFIAX or SPDR S&P 500 ETF and they will be depicted in other colors as well



 There should be a table showing the last 50 transactions with running balances on the right, where it looks like a real ledger.

 It should be machine-readable, and be able to be updated via another repo like https://github.com/AlbrightLaboratories/brightflow-ML/issues
