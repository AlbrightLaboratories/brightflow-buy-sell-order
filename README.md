# BrightFlow - Real-Time Buy/Sell Order Platform

BrightFlow is a sophisticated, real-time trading dashboard that leverages a machine learning backend to provide actionable buy/sell recommendations. This project demonstrates a modern, three-tier architecture, decoupling the frontend application from its live data source.

**This repository contains the frontend portion of the BrightFlow platform.** The backend server and the machine learning pipeline are managed in separate, private repositories.

## Core Features

- **Live Performance Dashboard:** Tracks the portfolio's performance against key market benchmarks (SPY, VFIAX) in real-time.
- **ML-Powered Recommendations:** A live ticker displays actionable buy/sell/hold recommendations generated by a sophisticated machine learning model.
- **Dynamic Transaction Ledger:** A detailed ledger of all historical trades, with filtering and dynamic updates.
- **Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
- **API-Driven Architecture:** The frontend is completely decoupled from the data source, fetching live data from a dedicated backend API. This eliminates data staleness and merge conflicts.

## New Architecture: The External API Approach

The project has been refactored to use a modern, API-driven architecture, which is significantly more robust and scalable than the previous file-based system. This change completely separates the frontend code from the data pipeline.

For a detailed explanation of this new architecture, please see the document: **[The External API Approach](./the-external-API-approach.md)**

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlbrightLaboratories/brightflow-buy-sell-order.git
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the platform. No local server is required. The site will fetch live data from the deployed BrightFlow Data API.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Charting:** Chart.js
- **Backend API:** Python (FastAPI) - *Managed in a separate repository*
- **ML Pipeline:** Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas) - *Managed in a separate repository*
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (Frontend), Render/Fly.io (Backend API)

## Project Status

**Current Version:** 2.0.0

This project has recently undergone a major architectural refactoring. The old, file-based data update workflow has been deprecated and removed in favor of a modern, decoupled, API-driven architecture. All obsolete scripts and documentation have been pruned from the repository.

For more details, see the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).
